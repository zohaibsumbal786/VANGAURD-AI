    `${article.excerpt} In practice, the difficult part is rarely the first working demo. The difficult part is creating a system that behaves consistently when the data is incomplete, the user changes direction, an external service is unavailable, or the business rule is more complicated than the original brief. That is where disciplined product engineering makes the difference.`,
    `The right starting point is a clear operating model. For ${article.category.toLowerCase()} work, we define the user or operator, the decision the system must support, the inputs it can trust, and the action that should happen next. This turns a broad technology request into a measurable workflow. It also exposes missing data, integration constraints, security requirements, and the edge cases that should be designed before implementation begins.`,
    `A dependable implementation separates the core capability from the surrounding product. The model, retrieval layer, dashboard, device, or automation engine should have a focused interface and testable behavior. Around it, the product needs validation, permissions, observability, versioning, and a clear failure path. This separation keeps iteration fast and makes it possible to improve one layer without destabilizing everything else.`,
    `For delivery, we recommend a staged path: prove the riskiest assumption first, connect the capability to a realistic slice of the workflow, measure it with representative data, and only then expand coverage. Teams should track technical metrics such as latency, error rate, data freshness, and evaluation quality alongside business metrics such as time saved, conversion, retention, or operating cost. A feature is ready when both sides are visible.`,
    `The lasting advantage comes from treating this work as a product, not a one-off experiment. Document the decisions, keep ownership of the data and code clear, and give the people using the system a way to report incorrect results. With that foundation, the technology can evolve as the business learns. The goal is not to add more complexity; it is to make the important work clearer, faster, and more reliable.`,
